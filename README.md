## A brief explanation about the game and rule of the game

This game is for 'Mooc Fi' python course 2023, as final exercise.
    First i wanted to thank all the people involved in this course And, 
    members of CS department of University of Helsinki. Amazing 
    course, it did wonders for me!
    
    The game Goldnerova includes :
    - a screen for title and description and rules
    - a game screen which is the playground and it contains an scoreboard
    - a notification page for winning and gameover
    - a menu screen

    How to play :
      player should control a robot using arrowkeys and trying to 
      collect coins to reach the goal (20 coins) while avoiding the
      flying ghosts entering the game from different angles. 
      After the player reached the goal, the robot should be guided to
      the door which is the final stage of the game. Bumping into ghosts
      more than 9 times is the gameover to make sure game will finish at
      some point in case the player being so bad at it.
    
    There is a Menu screen in game which is pretty simple and letting the user
    exits the game or restarts it.  Completing the game will take 30-90 
    seconds.
    ps. hope you do have the font i used for texts - its name is 
    Showcard Gothic apparently - otherwise with default font it gonna look dead!
